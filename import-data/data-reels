This is almost identical to the session version, other than being in Eflat, the only noticeable difference is that they have the repeated final measure as afeg fdd2 while the session version sounds like afe2 d4. For the A part they have measure 1 ABdf e2db and measure 3 ABdf efdf while the session has measure 3 more like measure 1 ABdf e2fg. Also for the second B repeat they have A2FA ABde|afeg fdd2 while the session has A2FA A2fg|afe2 d4.

* Mulvihill's ng305 ts2301 hnr67, since: <2007, composer:Charlie Mulvihill, notes: Something that came up when I was practicing on 2007-03-16. I think this is played in local sessions, but my source may be the version on Paddy Reynold's/Charlie Mulvihill/James Keane/Felix Dolan Atlantic Wave. Charlie Mulvihill is apparently the author, so I take the marking of the tune on that album as "Mulvihill's" as being somewhat authorative, and other names like "Murphy's" or "Paddy Murphy's Wife" probably are not Mulvihill's own designation of the tune. (Though admittedly, the Longford Collector is mislabelled as the Sailor's Bonnet on the album....)
