Importing
=========
I originally maintained the data that is now edited with the tunes application in flat text files. The files in this directory and `tools/importer` are used to import from those flat files to the tunes database. These are kept only for historical interest, and have no current purpose.

Usage
-----
``` sh
tools/importer -o newdb.sqlite import-data/*
```
