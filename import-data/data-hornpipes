* Tomgraney Castle ng3247, since:1997, notes: somehow learned it as (aa)(aa)(bb)(ba), but (Jimmy pointed out 2009-01-27) it's actually a normal hornpipe (aa)(aa)(ba)(ba), at least, that's how John Williams plays it, which was one source.

x 15 Kit O'Mahoney's ng1052 ts5970 , notes: related to jig of same name? O'Mahony was Francis O'Neill's mother's maiden name, but I can find no support (or contradiction) to the thesession.org claim that Kit was his mother's first name. The tune does appear in his collections.

May have been reminded of it from the Skellig from a few nights ago. It's in Cranitch's red book, and I've probably played it from there, though I don't remember conciously learning it.
