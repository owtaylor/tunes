-- Tune:
-- 	id = arbitrary integer
-- 	name = my preferred name. 'The' stripped, tune type stripped if possessive
-- 	   (so, Kerry Reel, but Bill Harte's, not Bill Harte's Jig)
-- 	aka = other names, ; separated. These are only "correct" names... that is,
-- 	   names that are in common use for the tune or originally given by the
-- 	   author. Mislabelling or one-off don't count.
-- 	composer: person who wrote the tune, if known
-- 	key = A {,b,#} {,min,dor,mix}
-- 	rhythm = reel,hornpipe,jig,slide,slip jig
-- 	refs = free text. ngNNNN tsNNNN hn<type>NNNN
-- 	notes
-- 	level =
-- 	       1 given name can start and play through with authority
-- 	       2 given first measure or two can play rest with comfort
--                  (maybe taking a time or two through to remember)
-- 	       3 basically know with some holes. (Can't remember
--                  A=>B transition, or some phrases eluding.)
--                  reel, fast hornpipe - can play along getting most passages right
--                  jig, polka - can follow comfortably
-- 	       4 familiar tune
--                  reel, fast hornpipe - fake a bit in a big group
--                  jig, polka - play along after a time or two through
-- 	       5 no better than "rings a bell"
--         maxlevel = once had it at this level
-- 	since = [<]YEAR. When first learned at L3 or better
-- 	incipit = abc for the start of the tune
-- 	study = 0,1 - worth some practicing
--         structure = each letter is a 8 bar segment. Exception: For slides letters are 4-bar segments
--             Variant endings not distinguished
--             8 bar segments that a 2x4 not distinguished
--             Double length segments get two letters
--             Absent = AABB, Single Reel AB, Trip to Durrow AABCBC
